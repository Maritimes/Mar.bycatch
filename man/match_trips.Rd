\usage{
match_trips(get_marfis = NULL, get_obs = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{get_marfis}{default is \code{NULL}. This is the list output by the
\code{Mar.bycatch::get_marfis()} function - it contains dataframes of both the
trip and set information from MARFIS}

\item{get_obs}{default is \code{NULL}. This is the list output by the
\code{Mar.bycatch::get_obs()} function - it contains dataframes of both the
trip and set information from the observer database.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to methods}
}
\value{
returns a list with 3 dataframes - MAP_OBS_MARFIS_TRIPS, MATCH_ISSUES, UNMATCHABLE & MATCH_SUMMARY
\itemize{
\item "MAP_OBS_MARFIS_TRIPS" - contains the TRIP_IDs from MARFIS and OBSERVER, and
an additional feld that indicates all of the ways the match was attained.
\item "MATCH_ISSUES" - contains any trips that were matched, but had at least one invalid/
unmatchable entry due to something like a bad trip name.
\item "UNMATCHABLE" - contains any records from both Marfis and Observer that could not be
matched to the other database using any method.
}
}
\description{
This function takes the results from get_marfis() and get_obs()
and attempts to match trips based on:
\itemize{
\item 1 = MARFIS confirmation numbers
\item 2 = Observer TRIP names (e.g. J18-0000)*
\item 3 = Correct combination of VRN and LICENCE and appropriate date range
}
* - only the alphanumeric characters of the trip names are used (e.g.
"J18-0000B" becomes "J180000B").
