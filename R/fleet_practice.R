#' @title fleet_practice
#' @description This function is a wrapper function that facilitates extracting the following
#' information for the practice fleets:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{fleet} - This is a dataframe of identifiers for all of the various trips undertaken by the
#'   selected fleet for the specified period (e.g. VRNs, licence IDs, Monitoring Document #s, etc)
#'   \item \code{marf} - This is a list of 3 sets of information for the commercial catch data (i.e. marfis)-
#'   the trips, the sets, and a special dataframe containing information that can be used to link
#'   the commercial data to the ISDB data
#'   \item \code{isdb} - This is a list of 4 data objects - 2 of which are all of the discovered ISDB data
#'   TRIPS and SETS for the fleet, as well as the TRIPS and SETS from the observer data that were
#'   sucessfully matched with the MARFIS data
#'   \item \code{bycatch} - This is a dataframe with the various species that were observed during observed
#'   trips.  For each species, the estimated number caught, the estimated kept wt (kgs) and the
#'   estimated discarded wt(kg) are all captured
#'   }
#' @param vessLen default is \code{NULL}.  This is a vector of vessel lengths.  If it is not NULL or
#' "all", it will be used to restrict vessels by their size.  The supplied vector will only be assessed
#' for its max and min values, so if you wanted vessels up to and including 45ft, you could enter either
#' of the following - \code{c(0,45)} or \code{seq(0,45,1)}.
#' @param ... other arguments passed to methods
#' @examples \dontrun{
#' stuff <- fleet_practice(data.dir = "C:/myData")
#' }
#' @family fleets
#' @return list of objects, including marfis data, isdb data, information for matching isdb
#' and marfis data, and a summary of bycatch

#'   \item \code{gearCode} = c(50,51)
#'   \item \code{mdCode} = c(1, 29)
